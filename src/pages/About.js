                                            <p>Hello, I am Keith, I am a Software Developer with a background in management and business development.
                                                The quality of skills that I have learned in my past professions are proving to be a great benefit to my growth as a Developer.
                                                I am always searching for new ways to improve my programming skills by keeping up to date with new tools and continuing to practice my craft. </p>



                                            <p>I find knowledge to be exciting which is my favorite aspect of programming.
                                                I always look forward to learning new techniques,  languages, tools, or technologies that I can use for a project.
                                                The challenges that come with continuous learning can be frustrating at first but I get a huge sense of fulfillment once I finally find a solution.
                                                Another aspect of programming that I really enjoy that stands out from other professions is the community. There is always someone who is willing to help and grow with you whether that is at a place of business or on a community forum like StackOverflow or Reddit.
                                            </p>



                                            <p>Outside of programming, I like to explore the City of Denverâ€™s restaurants, go to sporting events, and play video games with friends.
                                                I also have a fond love for Comedy, especially stand-up comedy.
                                                I really enjoy catching some of my favorite acts who come through Denver and look forward to new specials.
                                                Feel free to reach out and learn more about me!</p>
